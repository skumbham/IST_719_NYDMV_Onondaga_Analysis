# IST_719_NYDMV_Onondaga_Analysis

Welcome to the IST_719_NYDMV_Onondaga_Analysis repository. This repository contains analysis, data cleaning scripts, and visual materials related to vehicle registration transactions in Onondaga County, New York. The data was sourced from the New York State Open Data portal and encompasses a detailed set of records from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

## Repository Contents

- **NyDMV_Onondaga_Cleaning_RScript.R**: This R script is dedicated to cleaning the DMV data, preparing it for analysis by correcting inconsistencies, handling missing values, and more.
- **NyDmv_Onondaga_Code.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook created using Google Colab that contains the data analysis, including data manipulation and visualization scripts.
- **NyDmv_Onondaga_Poster.pdf**: A high-quality poster designed in Adobe Illustrator that visually represents the findings and insights from the analysis.
- **Data Folder**: Contains all raw data files (`Original_Data` and `DMV_Data`) used in this project.
- **Data Report**: Detailed report of the data analysis process, findings, and methodologies.
- **WIP Report**: A work in progress report which includes an outline and preliminary findings before finalizing the poster.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis can be found on the [New York State Open Data Portal](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Department-of-Motor-Vehicles-Registration-Transact/s2dd-yksa/about_data). The dataset includes a comprehensive log of vehicle registration transactions in New York State, focusing specifically on transactions occurring in Onondaga County.

## Visualization and Analysis

The analysis presented in this repository revolves around the exploration of vehicle registration patterns, identifying trends over time, and understanding the distribution of various attributes such as vehicle make, type, and registration class. The visualizations provided in the Jupyter Notebook and summarized on the poster help in making the insights more comprehensible and impactful.

**Poster Design**: The final poster was designed using Adobe Illustrator, ensuring that it not only conveys the analysis clearly but also engages viewers through aesthetic graphical representations.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have R and Python installed, along with necessary libraries as mentioned in the respective script and notebook.
3. Run the `NyDMV_Onondaga_Cleaning_RScript.R` to preprocess the data.
4. Execute the Jupyter Notebook `NyDmv_Onondaga_Code.ipynb` to view and interact with the analysis.

## Contribution

Contributions to this project are welcome. You can contribute by:
- Enhancing the data cleaning process.
- Extending the existing analysis with new hypotheses and advanced statistical techniques.
