# Onondaga County Vehicle Registration Trends Analysis

Welcome to the **Onondaga County Vehicle Registration Trends Analysis** repository. This project analyzes vehicle registration transactions in Onondaga County, New York, as part of the MS in Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies. The analysis investigates trends in vehicle registrations, make preferences, and registration types, offering insights that support policy planning and dealership marketing strategies.

## Repository Contents

- **`NyDMV_Onondaga_Cleaning_RScript.R`**: An R script for data cleaning, including handling missing values, correcting city name inconsistencies, and preparing data for analysis.
- **`NyDmv_Onondaga_Code.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook developed in Google Colab, containing the data analysis, visualizations, and trend exploration.
- **`NyDmv_Onondaga_Poster.pdf`**: A visually engaging poster designed with Adobe Illustrator that summarizes the projectâ€™s insights, highlighting key findings.
- **`Data Folder`**: Contains the original raw data file (`DMV_Data.csv`) from the New York State Open Data Portal.
- **`Data Report`**: A detailed report documenting the analysis process, findings, and methodologies applied in this project.
- **`WIP Report`**: A work-in-progress report containing preliminary findings and observations prior to finalizing the analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis is available on the [New York State Open Data Portal](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Department-of-Motor-Vehicles-Registration-Transact/s2dd-yksa/about_data). It includes comprehensive records of vehicle registration transactions throughout New York State, with a focus on Onondaga County. This dataset captures details such as vehicle make, registration type, and transaction class, providing a robust foundation for exploring regional vehicle trends.

## Visualization and Analysis

The analysis explores trends in vehicle registration patterns, including popular vehicle makes, body types, and registration classes, using data cleaning and visualization techniques to uncover meaningful insights:

- **Vehicle Brand Preferences**: Insights into the most popular vehicle brands in Onondaga County, assisting dealerships with inventory decisions.
- **Transaction Types**: Analysis of transaction types (e.g., renewals vs. new registrations) to understand customer behaviors and preferences.
- **City-wise Distribution**: Breakdown of vehicle registrations across cities, identifying high-activity areas such as Syracuse, Liverpool, and Manlius.
  
**Poster Design**: The final poster was created using Adobe Illustrator, enhancing the visual appeal and clarity of the insights presented. This design process ensured that the poster effectively communicates the findings while remaining visually engaging for viewers.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install R and Python with the required libraries specified in the R script and Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run `NyDMV_Onondaga_Cleaning_RScript.R` to clean and preprocess the data.
4. Open `NyDmv_Onondaga_Code.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab to view, interact with, and extend the analysis.
